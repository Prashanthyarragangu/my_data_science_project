your place in this high rising streetscape overlooking the stunning Dandenong Ranges.Superbly located in walking distance to Jells Park Primary and Caulfield Grammar, this refreshed family home puts the family front and centre to attend some of the district’s most respected schools.A north facing frontage delivers rich natural light into the grand front living room, which features grand picture windows to take in the garden’s greenery.Stylish engineered floating floors carry you across the main living space and walkways, with carpet under foot in the top floor rumpus and bedrooms.A family sized floor plan with 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and 2 living areas provides much needed space for the growing family across two light-filled levels.The kitchen is cleverly positioned in its own corner, appointed in stone benchtops and a vintage style Italian Ilve cooker, with easy viewing across the tiled meals area and lounge, creating a sense of inclusion across the home’s social hub.Of the 3 bathrooms, one compliments the master bedroom, the family bathroom offers a spacious setting with a semi frameless shower, floating vanity and separate toilet, and the 3rd bathroom is close to the pool so you can rinse off after a swim.Outside, generous paving presents plenty of outdoor living space around the in-ground pool, with the practicality of an undercover clothesline and enough space to play sport or ride bikes.It’s a highly appealing property at auspicious number 8, ready to welcome you with luck, space, and comfort, just within a few minutes drive to shopping, dining and transport connections at The Glen.","[{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/buxton-wheelers-hill-JTPRYL?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""Suite 4, Ground Floor, 2 Brandon Park Drive,

Well, for anyone serious on this land we have just that. The soil classification is type S which in short terms is the highest level of soil classification in the Eastport canals (that's a good thing when it comes to building). Or maybe your not quite ready to build. Well, buy now and hold to watch this nest egg grow as there are very few canal blocks available with no future releases. You couldn't ask for a much more vibrant and convenient location as this lot is only minutes away from the Port Bouvard Marina, numerous restaurants, the world renowned ""The Cut"" Golf Course, Falcon Primary School and Miami Shopping Plaza. It is also only a short distance from the stunning estuary and the soft sands of Avalon Bay which is well-known for its outer surf breaks and amazing snorkelling.The dolphins meander through the canals regularly and the blue manna crabs will be a regular treat for your numerous family and friends who will love to pop around for a visit. Spend relaxing mornings out on the estuary & ocean and sit back with a cold beer at the end of a busy day and watch the spectacular WA sunsets.This unique lot is perfectly positioned for families or couples seeking a relaxed waterfront lifestyle. With tranquil canal views and convenient boating access, this lot offers a magnificent canvas to build your dream residence.century 21 mandurah century 21  real estate  realestate real estate mandurahDISCLAIMER: This description has been prepared for advertising and marketing purposes only.

Add that this is a substantial 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom, single level home, with a pool and you have an absolute bargain for the Peregian market.The secret is that the interiors are ready for a serious makeover and this is recognised in the pricing.  You could do as much or little as you like, but given the location and the views, you will be well rewarded.You only have one adjoining neighbour as the block backs onto National Park and has a park to the northern side.Lounge and dining open to covered entertaining and pool area.  The large main bedroom has an ensuite and plenty of robes.  Bedrooms two and three have built in robes.  The fourth bedroom, if not required as such, would make an ideal office/study with lovely views of the courtyard.A substantial double carport incorporates storage and a workroom, while the outdoors offer easy maintenance.Put this on your inspection list for location and value and start planning your interior design.","[{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/lj-hooker-peregian-beach-XLJPER?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""222 David Low Way, PEREGIAN BEACH, QLD 4573"",""company_name"":""LJ Hooker - Peregian Beach"",""link"":null,""name"":null,""num_reviews"":0,""phone"":""07 5448 1500"",""start_rating"":0}]",

This house is approximately 25 squares in size, which is almost double the size of anything else in this quiet over 50s village, but not double the price. Realistically priced is this three bedroom two bathroom home that has a huge lounge room, a very sizeable dining room and a sunroom, which can be accessed both internally and from the garden. Beautiful Mountain views can be enjoyed from the front three rooms. This home has two master bedrooms, complete with their own en-suite bathrooms and large built in wardrobes. The third bedroom or study has a built-in Blackwood shelving over the entire wall. This would be perfect for a study or to show off your treasures.The huge lounge room has a custom made Tasmanian oak, glass door cabinet with full-length hinges, already in place, but believe me you will still have room for all of your precious furniture and bits and pieces.  Unusually this entire house and property has not one step in sight, with no fences to maintain, it has underground power, a ducted vacuum system and has NBN installed.There is a valuable rock wall at the rear, and the garden soil is excellent for growing fruit trees.  There is a particularly abundant Moor Park apricot tree in the front garden. This home has insulation in the ceiling, and has excellent and efficient heating and a drying cupboard in the laundry.Entry is either off Village Drive or park in the oversized double carport with ample space to reverse your vehicle and drive out front ways and with extra off street car parking.  This would be great for the extended family when they are visiting.There is a new electrical switchboard that has been installed by a master electrician.

Centrally located to the whole of the Gold Coast and easy access to Brisbane, Benowa provides massive rental potential for apartments and townhouses, within walking distance to Benowa State School, Botanic Gardens and local shops. Comprising of 17 apartments, 7 townhouses many with exceptional skyline views and thoughtfully designed alfresco spaces the potential development caters to a wide range of buyers and tenants. This is a totally unique opportunity with no similar developments sites available for sale in the area.  The block is ready to build on and with high demand from buyers in unit and townhouse resales, all offerings are expected to sell prior to construction completion. The realistic seller has chosen not to take on a development of this scale and instead enjoy some free time and is keen to move it on quickly.
